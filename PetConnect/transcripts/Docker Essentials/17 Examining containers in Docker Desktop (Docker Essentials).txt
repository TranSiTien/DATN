you don't even have to do the pull and
run
let me show you i'm going to switch over
to our docker hub
and we are going to run a container
without
even doing
a pull
right so let's run something else httpd
all right let's run this guy
so we did two steps right we did pull so
that the image gets downloaded and then
we did run we can just do docker run
okay so i'm gonna go over here
to
my terminal
and instead of running dockable and
docker i'm going to say docker
run
httpd
okay
it is going to say see unable to find
the image httpd locally which means
where does it go it goes to docker hub
and it's going to download the image and
then spin up a new container with the
contents of that image
of course i haven't given it any
process to run so either it is going to
run it either is going to end right away
or it is going to have its own process
that runs but yeah so it runs httpd in
the in the foreground okay so this is
i'm going to talk about this later a
container can have an opinion of what it
needs to run
okay it's like you're running httpd
which is basically a web server whenever
you run it it just has a default process
that it starts with you can override it
but it has a default process to start
with i'm going to talk about that when
we create our images
i'm going to kill this because i don't
want this to run
and now if i go to a new command and
then ps let's say
docker ps
dash a
and i just do drps
these are
well that that since i closed the tab
this container is now exited see here it
exited eight seconds ago so
that container doesn't is not running
anymore
all right so we looked at this docker
pull image name
pulls the latest tag you can specify
your own tag if you like and it is going
to pull that tag so every image has a
tag associated with it it's just an
arbitrary label
you can call it foo and you say image
name colon foo and it is going to pull
that
now the thing to remember is that uh
docker run or any of these docker
commands needs that daemon to run okay
if you don't have docker desktop running
you will get this error this cannot
connect to the docker daemon is the
docker daemon
running
okay it's necessary for it to run in
with the docker desktop it's that wheel
icon that sits in your tray make sure
you run that if you don't run that
you're gonna get errors you can try as i
do these things you can try these
commands on your own since you have
docker installed you should be able to
basically replicate exactly what i'm
doing
okay
view what's happening
in docker desktop so if you click on
that wheel icon on the
tray and open up the
ui
ui is going to look something like this
okay so here are here are all the
containers that i have run
along with the
status
and now you can you do a bunch of things
here that you would otherwise have to do
in the cli so you know depending on
whether you're a cli person or a ui
person you can do the stuff you can
end these containers and all that stuff
and here's an interesting link you have
images here and this is going to show
you all the images that i have
downloaded there's no surprise here i
have alpine image which is in use tag is
latest i have another alpine which is
3.14.3 which is just downloaded for
demonstration purposes and i didn't even
bother to use it
httpd latest it's in use ubuntu latest
with some news notice the the size of
these images they're pretty small right
you look at this alpine is just like
five to six mb httpd which is like a
full web server is basically 143 mb
which is nothing in this day and age
ubuntu which you know if you download a
distro
you get like a i don't know like a 1gb
destroy image but this ubuntu is just 72
mb because it doesn't have to bundle all
the kernel it just has to bundle the
things that make ubuntu different from
any typical linux kernel so
that's uh that's why it's it's so small
