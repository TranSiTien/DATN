moving on to
running node.js without installing
node.js i don't know how many of you
folks are node.js developers here but i
thought i'd cover this as well this is
pretty
simple as well okay
we have an image called
node so if you go again to docker hub
they're among the top images like you
want to run python without installing
python well here's your answer
okay uh node is over here right again
look at the tags see what version you
need oh man there are so many tags for
this guy so you can pick one of these
tags and say node colon and then put the
tag there or you just say docker on node
and that should be just fine so here
is basically instead of open jdk
node again it doesn't find it locally
it's going to go ahead and download it
and uh open bash now i can
run node commands
let's make sure this goes through
okay notice a little bigger
who'd have thought
okay so here i am and then say uh
node and i'm in note shell okay
so i'm in note shell so this is this is
basically how you can
run
uh node and again this can be this can
be anything right you can you can have
your files there you can create like a
js file and say node and then run that
file and it is going to print basically
the output to the console and so on
so this is how you can run these things
and the same thing applies for any of
these other technologies as well just
get the container and use the container
and you can mix and match
and try all those different things
all right docker is programming language
agnostic yes very much so very much so
you can really do whatever it's it's not
even it's not even about programming
languages like we looked at radius as an
example you can run read as a you know a
node of radius on your machine just by
running that container that should that
should do
what if two containers use the same
library like java well they're gonna
have two copies of java installed
on in the container
so they're not gonna mess with each
other because of the isolation
guarantees that docker provides
you're perfectly fine it's not gonna
cause problems
