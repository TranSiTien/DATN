how do you run java without installing
java
of course one option you run it in the
cloud but uh how do you run it locally
so i'm gonna switch to the
docker hub here
and the go to
this
image that i
tend to use a lot
which is open jdk
okay there's an open jdk image it's an
official image so i don't have to worry
about it
by the docker folks
and here is
here's open jdk it's an open source
implementation of the java platform
standard edition
cool
now if you go to look at the labels
look at the tags
you will see all the different versions
you see here there are there are a bunch
of documentation as well say open jdk
colon version and you have like you know
8 11 12 all that good stuff
i'm going to get the latest
all right
i'm going to run
java
without installing java and here's how
all right so i'm going to clear this out
this is my windows terminal okay whether
i have java installed here or not
doesn't matter i'm going to run it in a
container and here's how i do it i say
docker run
i'm going to say interactive terminal
what's the image that i need it is
open jdk if i have a specific version in
mind i'm going to do colon and then
enter the version number i'm just going
to go with the latest for this example
and then i'm going to say
bash i don't know if there is bash
installed in this in this container but
let's see i'm going to hit this hit
enter and now it says not able to find
open jdk locally it is going to download
it
and throw me a prompt
which has you know it's going to throw
me in a container
which has java installed okay i'm going
to show you what that looks like when it
when it loads
all right so it should put me in a
prompt which is batch prompt so it turns
out open jdk has
bash installed i type ls
now here is me inside my
linux which has open jdk installed you
can say java
version you see i'm on java 1701
open jdk runtime all right that's pretty
cool right so i can say
j shell
and i'm over here i'm right i can write
but let's say what i want to type
system dot out dot
println
hello this is truly java it prints hello
so i am basically running java
on windows okay so i can create a
directory over here create a java file
use the java c command java c is
available as well so i can use all these
commands compile java code build java
code all that stuff i can do inside this
container okay we're not running code
here yet we're going to do this later
but i wanted to show you how you can
get to an environment the linux
environment where you have precisely the
java version of your choice and nothing
else no java home to mess with none of
this stuff it's all set up all ready for
you to go okay you want to switch java
version well you have to uninstall java
on your machine well no you just switch
to that different container and that
container has only that version of java
and nothing else so it's it's perfect
you want to play around and you're not
bothered with installing java on your
machine again i'm going to talk about
how to write code and you know do some
more advanced stuff in a little bit
