so what i'm going to do is first get rid
of these
folders that were created by mysql
so that
this location is empty
and i want to show you a workflow of
creating a java file
and basically compiling it and running
without
needing to install java we we kind of
talked a little bit about that at the
you know earlier where we
run the java like j shell and we were
able to run java commands without
installing java locally well one of the
problems there was like yeah what if you
build a java application no you don't
have access to it because the container
ends your code ends right it is too
isolated too restricted well now with
volume mount we now have a way to create
a workflow
and you can make this happen so here's
here's how you do it now i'm going to
create
a java file
hello
java
and i'm just using notepad here just for
the sake of simplicity
it shouldn't matter what editor you use
okay so i'm going to say
public
class
hello
and uh
public static wide mean and here i'm
just going to do a system
dot out
hello okay
simple java file
i can use my my host operating systems
editors so let's say i have you know
obviously wouldn't use intellij if the
constraint is to not have java installed
in your machine maybe some simple editor
like what i did notepad here or vs code
or whatever right now i have this java
file now i want to compile and run it
without having to install
java well you know the answer now what i
can do is i can volume mount this
folder
into the container and i will have
access to run this in the container i'm
going to try this out okay i'm going to
do a docker run
and i'm going to remove this because i
don't want this around like i'm just
temporary container i need an
interactive shell
and i'm going to volume mount this i'm
going to say
this present working directory
is going to be volume mounted to i don't
know i'm going to call this slash
java code okay some folder in my
containers host containers file tree i'm
going to say open
jdk
and i want the shell
okay
now i'm going this is going to
darker and what happened
invalid reference format
ah there was an extra space here i need
to get rid of the space right the
both sides of the colon that should mean
space
now i'm thrown into the shell
and here i have this folder called java
code i'm gonna go to
java code and here is my hello.java and
now i have my java runtime java compiler
and all that stuff i can say java
hello.java this is a trick by the way if
you're used to older versions of java
you don't know this you can just write
java and the java file it is going to
compile and run it in one chat okay so i
say java
it runs it right and now i can exit
let's say i want to compile it i can say
java c
hello.java now it has compiled it to
that location i exit to the container
and now here in my host location i have
a compiled java
file without having to install java
right i'm able to compile it to run it
and all that stuff okay so now this has
a sense of kind of permanence now what i
can do is i can you can imagine like i
open the the project
in my host location whatever favorite
ide that i have start this container and
then i compile and run while i edit it
in my host editor right that makes it
super powerful it's a good user workflow
that i have and i can work on complex
projects this way
okay if you look at the kind of like the
docker support or the container support
that something like visual studio code
uses for example they kind of basically
doing the same thing right it's mounting
this kind of making your host code
directories available inside the
container and use the containers
runtimes for compiling and building and
all that stuff while your code exists
here you want to check into source code
you can do it directly from your host
operating system if you like okay
