Let's get into the chroot disclaimer. You don't have to know chroot for using Docker, but understanding chroot will help you understand Docker, and I hope you will agree with me once I show you this thing. Here is the definition of chroot: it's a chroot on a Unix operating system. An operation that changes the apparent root directory for the currently running process and its children, all right? It's an apparent root directory. When you run an application, it knows what the root directory is, right? You have a root directory on your machine, and you can basically make it think that the root directory is something else, right? I'm going to give you a demo of this thing, and you will understand what this is, all right?

Switch over here to my terminal window. All right, I'm running Linux here, right? I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm running a bit later, but you can guess what this is. But I'm not going to give any spoilers now. This is Linux, okay? So I type ls, and here is my directory. I have two folders that I've prepared over here, which are chroot demo and chroot demo with ls, okay? So chroot demo contains three directories: bin, lib, and lib64. This one also contains bin, lib, and lib64. So I don't know if I have tree here. Let's see. I don't have tree installed. Well, I can just show you this thing. See, chroot demo. So bin has one run executable called bash. Okay, I have a lib folder which has a bunch of libraries. These are libraries necessary for bash to run. Okay, and there is also a lib64 which is another file. So this is actually common in Linux runtime. So when you install a program, the executable goes to the bin directory and the libraries go to lib and lib64 directories. It seems everything I'm telling you seems like very much Linux internals, but bear with me here. This will make sense in a bit. Now, what I've done here is I have copied the bash. Bash is basically a shell, right? Bash is what you run commands. It's a shell. What I'm doing here is basically a shell, right? It's a prompt. I can type something here and it runs it. Well, guess what? That is an application. What I've done here is I've taken, I've put that executable in the bin directory. I've put the libraries in the lib and lib64 directory. Now, every application in Linux has this executable and libraries. So you can find out what it is by typing ldd and then the command /bin/bash and it will tell you, well, bash requires these libraries. Okay, so these libraries are in lib. You know, these three files are in lib and this file is in lib64. So what I've done here is I've created this directory where I have just got the bash executable and the libraries required for bash to run. Okay, so now what I can do here is I can do chroot. I can run this command chroot chroot demo and then bash. So what I'm saying is, hey, I want a new shell to be created over here which thinks that this is the root directory. Okay, remember the definition is chroot changes the apparent root directory for some process. Okay, and now here that process is bash. For bash, change the apparent root directory to be this directory. If I do this, what happened? I'm going to go one level back and run this. So now what I have is a bash prompt. I'm running bash, but you notice here, if I say the current working directory, it says it's /. It thinks it's in root. I'm actually in that chroot demo folder now, but it doesn't think that. It thinks it's in root, right? If I do ls, I don't even have ls because guess what? ls is another command, right? So what I have here is now I have a shell which doesn't do much because this, let me exit this here. Okay, so according to that shell, this directory is everything. This directory is the entire operating system. So I couldn't even run ls there, right? So I can get into that anytime and get out of it. And now when I'm in that shell, it thinks that this directory is the root and I get out of the shell. Now I'm in another shell which thinks which has a true idea of what root is, okay? Does that make sense? Let me know if you have any questions. I'm going to show you another example, okay? So I have another directory which is chroot with ls. Now here is what I've done. I have copied over
