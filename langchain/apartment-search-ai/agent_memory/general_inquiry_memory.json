Can you explain what I need to do?\n\nAI: Absolutely! The application process for renting an apartment typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Submit an Application**: You'll need to fill out an application form for the apartment you're interested in. This usually requires your personal information, rental history, and employment details.\n\n2. **Pay an Application Fee**: Many landlords require an application fee to process your application. This fee is typically non-refundable.\n\n3. **Background and Credit Check**: The landlord or property management may conduct a background check and a credit check to assess your rental history and financial responsibility.\n\n4. **Provide Documentation**: You may need to provide documents such as pay stubs, bank statements, or references to support your application.\n\n5. **Wait for Approval**: After submitting your application, you'll need to wait for the landlord to review it and make a decision. This can take anywhere from a few days to a week.\n\n6. **Sign the Lease**: If approved, you\u2019ll be invited to sign a lease agreement, outlining the terms of your rental.\n\n7. **Pay Deposits**: Before moving in, you typically need to pay the security deposit and the first month's rent.\n\nIf you have more specific questions or need assistance with a particular step, feel free to ask!", "timestamp": "2025-06-08T17:26:00.191908", "metadata": {"query_type": "general"}}, {"role": "user", "content": "what did I just say to you", "timestamp": "2025-06-08T17:26:46.529075", "metadata": {"email": "annetn924@gmail.com"}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It looks like you are asking for clarification on your previous message.
